 “I don’t presume to have any answers; I ask questions. If I give a special status to the question, that is because I find something unsatisfactory about the nature of the answer.... Answers embody a certain form of power. Whereas the question is a form of non-power. But a subversive kind of non-power, one that will be upsetting to power.”

Edmond Jabes

 

Course Description

I welcome you to ENGW 1111. Our course introduces techniques and practices that promote confidence building and growth-oriented college level literacy. Throughout our semester your curiosities and experiences regarding reading and writing will develop through community engagement with our texts, myself, and your peers. We focus on essays, articles, speeches, art (visual, music, and media) and talks, lectures. Engaging with these genres enhances your knowledge of how language works within relationship to yourself, to those around you, and to the world. Once you have built a comprehension of these genres and ideas, pathways to integrate them into your reading and writing will be actualized.

Course Theme

What is POSITIVE RADICAL JOY in the context of a class like this?  Before you jump to any conclusions, let me give you my take as a starting point. I have been reading Ross Gay’s  The Book Of Delights. His book reaffirms to me that joy’s presence shapes classroom communities. Absence of joy can lead to disillusionment, depletion, and lack of care. In contrast, presence of joy can bring challenge, encouragement, openness, and dependability. Critical thinking that nourishes the self, our classroom community, and the world, is a form of joy. Joy, when paired with critical thinking, is fundamental, far-reaching, hence its radicalism. Our class theme, Positive Radical Joy: Reading and Writing Beneath the Surface, embodies these principles. My teaching methods prioritize globally recognized writers and artists who reflect our course theme. Including influential authors broadens our accountability as critical and compassionate readers, writers and thinkers. By expanding our understanding of love and critical thinking to hold multiple voices and perspectives, we will find that all of us have individual and collective stories to tell. So what can POSITIVE RADICAL LOVE encompass for you? Before you answer, think about the possibilities?

 

Course Philosophy and work load

Let's start with what we love. I want each and every one of you to thrive as writers, readers and members of this community that is the classroom. I want you to engage with the practice and development of writing as it relates to the things and ideas that sparks your interest and holds your imagination. To that end, I want each member of this class to choose a topic that they will want to explore throughout the course. You will write three essays, a multimodal creative presentation, and a notebooking portfolio.

 

narrative Essay—3 Pages, 20% of grade

persuasive Essay(citing 2 sources)—3-5 pages, 20% of grade

Research based Metacognitive Essay (citing at least 4 sources)—4-6 Pages, 20% of grade

Multimodal Creative Presentation as introduction to the subjectivity of the Metacognitive Essay, 5-7 minutes, 20% of grade

Participation including, notebook portfolios, engagement, 20% of grade. When I ask that you turn in assignments, be it an in class exercise or a specific response as part of your note booking process, you will not be graded but the completions of those designated assignments will count towards the participation aspect of the grade. It does matter in a big way. Please participate and demonstrate your presence in this classroom and community.

 

 

Grading Philosophy

Class attendance, participation, and turning in assignments on time, will guarantee a passing grade in this course, maybe even do well in this class. If you want to excel in this course, then you will need to show up to class prepared, ready and willing to participate in ways that feel comfortable and show what you are learning. Your papers will be graded with a rubric based on labor and effort. This will be explained in further detail for each assignment. Essentially, there will be markers established for your efforts and the rigors of your investigation in your writing versus the content of your writing, to establish a grade for the assignment. The commitment to this methodology versus traditional grading is that your efforts in the course are graded above the expectations or opinions of others regarding your work.

Notebook Portfolios will be considered part of the overall effort of the course and factored into the consideration of your participation in the course. As such, you will be asked to share your reactions, analysis and questions throughout the course in the form of class shares and discussions. It will require that the work of "notebooking" become a committed and weekly practice.

Attendance Policy:

They say that showing up is 80% of life. I am a firm believer in the power of showing up. As such, you can miss up to four classes, the equivalent of two entire week's worth of class time. Missing a 5th class will result in a course grade reduction. If you earned an A for the course but missed more than 4 classes, you could receive a final grade of A- or lower. In other words, make very effort to attend classes. Talk to me if you are experiencing challenges that affect your attendance, I am here to support you and will gladly work with you to address these concerns.

Chat GPT and AI philosophy

at no point in the history of human kind, we are more equipped with the tools to support our endeavors to communicate than now.  As such I am not one to resist these changing times. I want to us to utilize and benefit from the tools at our disposal. I encourage you to use these technological advances as editing tools for the purpose of spell checking and aiding with issues of grammar. What I do not want you to do is allow this technology to think on your behalf.  In other words, do not use AI to generate drafts of your work. This cannot and will not be considered as original work and is subjected to Northeastern University's rules, regulations and code of ethics on plagiarism.

I am inviting you to think freely in this course. to utilize your imagination, to take a position, and to assert your thinking. Do this and i promise you that I will acknowledge, applaud, and credit  your efforts throughout the process. Always claim your right to think for yourself. You have a right to your humanity.

The Syllabus As A Critical Guiding tool for The class

The syllabus will be used in every aspect of this class on a daily basis. It is where all links and information pertaining to the class are housed. It is also where themes and parameters for  class discussions are outlined to give you a sense of where our explorations and discussions going with the materials we engage with in class. You should have access to your syllabus at all times in order to gain access to important content be it readings or links to video documentaries, talks and creatives.

LEARNING GOALS

 

Rhetorical Practices

    Students write both to learn and to communicate what they learn.
    Students negotiate their own writing goals and audience expectations regarding genre, context, and situation.
    Students formulate and articulate a stance through and in their writing.
    Students reflect on their writing processes and self-assess as writers.

 

Engagement with Critical Perspectives

    Students explore diverse experiences, perspectives, and ideas--such as intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, language, and ability--in campus, societal, disciplinary, professional, or historical contexts.
    Students engage in activities that help them understand and critique systemic inequity to foster a commitment to justice at Northeastern and globally.

 

Use of Sources and Evidence

    Students generate and pursue lines of inquiry and search for, collect, and select sources that effectively support their writing projects.
    Students effectively use and cite sources in their writing.
    Students use multiple forms of evidence to support their claims, ideas, and arguments.
    Students practice critical reading strategies.

 

Revision

    Students provide feedback to their peers to help them revise.
    Students revise their writing using responses from others, including peers, teachers, writing center tutors, and community members.

 

WRITING PROGRAM POLICIES

 

Security and Privacy in Online Learning

The Northeastern Writing Program strives to maintain your privacy while learning in online environments. For this reason, our instructors use Northeastern's Learning Management System, Canvas.

 

We also ask that all students in Writing Program classes must use their Northeastern email addresses to receive email from their instructors and to access sites for their writing courses. This policy ensures your emails will not mistakenly end-up in a spam folder and protects you against security attacks. 

 

Minimum Grade Requirement to Pass a Writing Program course

A student must receive a grade of C or better in order to pass a required writing course in the writing program (C is required for graduation). Any student earning a C- or lower will need to repeat the course in order to fulfill the writing requirement. The instructor makes the final decision with respect to any grade between A and C. Any student receiving lower than a C will be reviewed and signed off on by a committee of 3-6 Writing Program instructors or a writing program director.

 

If the university allows students to select the pass/fail grading option for writing program courses, students must receive the equivalent of a “pass” to fulfill the writing requirement.

 

Grade Appeals

Students who wish to appeal final course grades, should follow the policy outlined in the student handbook:http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-2020-UG-Handbook.pdf

Attendance 

Unless identified as an online class, all classes are on ground, and students should anticipate attending in person. 

 

According to the official Northeastern University Attendance Requirements

Links to an external site.

Links to an external site.

Links to an external site.

, students have the right to a limited number of excused absences, including absences due to specific university-sponsored activities, religious holidays, military deployment, and jury duty.

 

“Class participation is essential to success no matter the course format or its delivery; therefore, attendance is mandatory. Individual instructors may have additional, course-specific, attendance policies. It is the student’s responsibility to ascertain what each instructor requires.”

 

Writing classes require regular engagement with the class materials and the instructor. In all courses, “attendance” refers to regular, ongoing participation in discussions, weekly posted work, and other assignments. Students should also maintain regular communication with the course instructor. 

 

Wellness Days

Northeastern has implemented a Wellness Day Pilot Program aimed at prioritizing student mental health. Wellness Days can and should be used when a student wishes to be absent from a day of classes, whether it’s due to mental health, emotional wellbeing, physical illness, or personal circumstances. Taking a day to perform some self-care or seek assistance from available resources will allow students to return to class with renewed purpose.

 

A description of Wellness Days and how to apply for them can be found at https://wellnessdays.studentlife.northeastern.edu/overview/

Late Submissions of Written Work

Unless you have an accommodation provided by the Disability Resource Center that allows you extra time to complete an assignment or have discussed an extension with your instructor, you are expected to submit all materials by the assigned due date.

 

Academic Integrity

Northeastern University is committed to the principles of intellectual honesty and integrity: the Northeastern Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy may be found at https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/

) provides extensive information on student conduct, the disciplinary process, and the range of available sanctions. All members of the Northeastern community are expected to maintain complete honesty in all academic work, presenting only that which is their own work in tests and assignments. In writing program classes, this definition of plagiarism applies not only to borrowing whole documents, but also to borrowing parts of another’s work without proper acknowledgment and proper paraphrasing or quotation. The OSCCR website also offers a useful Citations and Integrity Checklist

Use of ChatGPT and AI Content Generators

As expressed in the Writing Program’s learning goals

we value the deeply human process of writing as inquiry, knowledge generation, and expression. The writing process itself is a means of organizing our thinking, exploring and understanding our world, and engaging with one another.

 

Instructors have the right to establish policies for the use of ChatGPT and AI content generators within their individual classes. Those policies may include: guidelines to acknowledge their use, defined uses for individual projects and exercises, and/or prohibition or restriction of their use. It is the responsibility of the student to review and understand the policy established by their instructor regarding the use of ChatGPT and AI content generators.

 

Recording

Students are not allowed to record classes whether in visual or audio forms without the consent of the instructor and all class participants, except as necessary to provide reasonable auxiliary aids and academic adjustments to disabled students. As per California Recording Laws:

 

“In California, it is a criminal offense to use any device to record communications, whether 

they’re wire, oral or electronic, without the consent of everyone taking part in the 

communication. This means that in California you are not legally allowed to record a conversation you are taking part in unless all parties are in agreement.”

 

https://recordinglaw.com/party-two-party-consent-states/california-recording-laws/

 

Respecting Diversity

Writing program instructors seek to foster inclusive learning environments and cherish our students’ multilingual funds of knowledge. That means, we respect differences in learning as well as cultural differences that arise during classroom interactions. We also value each student’s right to their own languages and dialects, and we expect students in writing program classes to respect these diverse perspectives. 

 

We also respect any privacy concerns students may have, regarding joining classes remotely from overseas, country/region-specific accessibility issues, English language difficulties, and culturally informed genre styles. If you are a multilingual student and have specific concerns and questions, contact Professor Qianqian Zhang-Wu, Director of Multilingual Writing, at qzhangwu@northeastern.edu 

 

Collection of Student Work for Program Assessment

Your instructor may be asked to submit one or more samples of your writing to the Writing Program Assessment Committee for the purpose of program assessment. Student work is randomly selected and used solely for the purpose of program-level assessment. Looking at student writing from a programmatic perspective helps us improve our program. Student writing collected for this purpose is never circulated outside the Writing Program for any reason. We report only aggregate data to those outside the program; no teachers or students are identified in these reports. If you have any questions or concerns about our program assessment, feel free to contact Professor Laurie Nardone, Writing Program Director, at l.nardone@northeastern.edu

WRITING PROGRAM and UNIVERSITY RESOURCES

 

The Writing Center

The Northeastern University Writing Center offers free tutoring to serve and assist the broader Northeastern community at any stage of the writing process.

Consulting sessions last for 45 minutes and are tailored to serve each individual writer’s goals and concerns, with the understanding that writing growth is a continual process which cannot be completed in a single day or session. At the Writing Center, we affirm and value all languages and Englishes; we understand that writing serves multiple purposes and that effective writing takes many forms beyond the constraints of Standard American English.
